# Open-Source Threat Intelligence Newsletter Summaries (OS-TINS)

OS-TINS is an experimental Python tool that is looking to leverage RSS Feeds from popular cybersecurity news platforms and Large Learning Models (LLMs) in order to provide a free open-source alternative to threat intelligence feed platforms. The LLM will summarize all articles from an input date to provide a summarized newsletter, referencing and linking the articles allowing the user to explore in more depth. Note that LLMs are not perfect and can make mistakes, ALWAYS verify the referenced sources.
