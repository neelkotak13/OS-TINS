Mark Lanterman, a Minnesota cybersecurity expert who testified in thousands of trials, is under investigation by the FBI due to questions surrounding his credentials. Allegations include lying about his education (degrees from Upsala College and postgraduate work at Harvard) and employment history. A law firm defending a case where Lanterman provided forensic review found no record of his degrees and revealed that his "postgraduate work" at Harvard was actually an eight-week online class. Lanterman has admitted he can't prove his attendance at Upsala College. He's also accused of unethical business practices, including holding client data for ransom over billing disputes. Several past clients have complained about his practices. The situation could lead to the reopening of past cases where Lanterman's testimony was crucial, including a high profile murder conviction. Allwine, who was found guilty of killing his wife two years earlier after attempts at hiring a hitman on the dark net fell through. Allwine is serving a sentence of life in prison, and continues to maintain that he was framed, casting doubt on computer forensic evidence found on 64 electronic devices taken from his home.
