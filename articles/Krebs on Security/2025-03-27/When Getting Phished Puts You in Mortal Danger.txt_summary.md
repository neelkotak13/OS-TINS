The article details a network of phishing websites targeting Russians who are searching online for organizations fighting against the Russian government's war in Ukraine. These fake sites mimic recruitment pages for Ukrainian paramilitary groups and government intelligence agencies. The purpose is to collect personal information from potential recruits, which could then be used by Russian intelligence services to identify and arrest individuals for "anti-war" activities, potentially leading to long prison sentences or worse. Security researchers have identified connections between these sites and a "bulletproof hosting" network with ties to Russian intelligence, and have observed them ranking highly in search results on engines like Yandex, DuckDuckGo, and Bing, suggesting manipulation of search engine optimization (SEO). The article emphasizes that those seeking to join Ukrainian organizations must be wary of these traps, as they can lead to severe consequences.
