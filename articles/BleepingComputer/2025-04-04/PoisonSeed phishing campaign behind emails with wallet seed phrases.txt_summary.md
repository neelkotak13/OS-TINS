The "PoisonSeed" campaign is a large-scale phishing operation that compromises corporate email marketing accounts at platforms like Mailchimp, SendGrid, and HubSpot to distribute emails containing crypto seed phrases. These emails, often disguised as alerts from Coinbase or Ledger, trick recipients into entering the provided seed phrase into a new wallet, effectively giving attackers control and allowing them to drain the cryptocurrency. Attackers identify high-value targets within companies using these platforms, craft sophisticated phishing emails to steal credentials, and then export mailing lists to send out the crypto-themed phishing spam. Users are advised to ignore urgent email requests, log into platforms independently to check for alerts, and never use a seed phrase provided by someone else.
