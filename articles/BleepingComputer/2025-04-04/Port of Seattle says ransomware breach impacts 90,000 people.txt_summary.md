In August 2024, the Port of Seattle suffered a ransomware attack by the Rhysida group, disrupting several services. While the Port refused to pay the ransom, personal data was stolen, leading to notifications being sent to roughly 90,000 affected individuals in April 2025. The stolen data included employee, contractor, and parking information, potentially containing names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver's license details, and some medical information. The Port clarified that passenger information and payment systems were unaffected and that travel safety was never compromised. The Rhysida ransomware group has been linked to other high-profile attacks.
