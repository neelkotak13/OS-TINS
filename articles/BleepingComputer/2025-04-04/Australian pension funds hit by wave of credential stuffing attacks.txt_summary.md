A large-scale credential stuffing attack recently targeted several major Australian superannuation funds, including AustralianSuper, Hostplus, REST, Australian Retirement Trust, and Insignia Financial. While most attempts were repelled, over 20,000 accounts were breached, with some members potentially losing savings. Specific impacts varied: AustralianSuper reported 600 accounts breached, REST had limited personal data accessed for 8,000 members, and Insignia Financial saw 100 accounts compromised on its Expand Platform. Hostplus reported no member funds lost. ASFA has launched a hotline and toolkit to coordinate the industry's response. HESTA and Mercer Super were not affected. Concerns are being raised about the lack of mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) on some platforms.
