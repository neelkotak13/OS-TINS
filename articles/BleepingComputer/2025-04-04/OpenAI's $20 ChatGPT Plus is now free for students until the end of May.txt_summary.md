OpenAI is offering free ChatGPT Plus subscriptions to college students in the US and Canada until the end of May. This limited-time offer gives students access to premium features, including advanced AI models like GPT-o1 and o3-mini/high reasoning models, which are normally part of the $20/month subscription. OpenAI will verify student status through SheerID using methods like university databases and single sign-on. This move follows a similar educational offering from rival AI company Anthropic.
