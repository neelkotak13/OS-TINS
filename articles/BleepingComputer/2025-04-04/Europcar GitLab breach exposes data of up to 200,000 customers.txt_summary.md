Europcar Mobility Group suffered a data breach where a hacker stole source code from their GitLab repositories, including code for Android and iOS apps, and personal data (names and email addresses) of between 50,000 and 200,000 Goldcar and Ubeeqo customers. The hacker attempted to extort the company by threatening to release 37GB of stolen data. While Europcar confirms the breach and is assessing the damage, the company states that more sensitive data such as bank details and passwords were not compromised. They are notifying affected customers and the data protection authority. The method of initial access is unknown. This isn't the first time Europcar has faced security issues, including a fake breach claim last year and a discovered admin token in their mobile apps in 2022.
