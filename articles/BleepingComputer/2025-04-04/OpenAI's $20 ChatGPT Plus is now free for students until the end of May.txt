ChatGPT Plus subscription is now free, but only if you're a student based out of the United States of America and Canada.
ChatGPT Plus is a premium subscription that costs $20 a month and allows you to access the paid models, including GPT o1, which is the company's best reasoning model.
Additionally, it gives you access to o3-mini and o3-high reasoning models, which are absent from the free tier.
OpenAI is making these features free for college students just in time for final exams.
However, according to an FAQ document, students will be able to access the Premium tier for free until the end of May only.
"We are offering a Plus discount for students on a limited-time basis in the US and Canada," the company noted in a FAQ.
"This is an experimental consumer program and we may or may not expand this to more schools and countries over time."
OpenAI will verify if you're a student before you can avail the offer
OpenAI says it will verify student status using SheerID’s secure verification system, which confirms your eligibility through multiple methods:
-
Authoritative Sources: SheerID first checks trusted databases, such as your university's Office of the Registrar, to instantly verify your student status.
-
Single Sign-On (SSO): If necessary, you’ll be prompted to log in securely with your school's SSO credentials, confirming your affiliation directly through your institution.
This move comes after rival AI company Anthropic announced Claude for Education, which helps students learn concepts using AI.
