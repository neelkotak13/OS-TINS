Coinbase is addressing a confusing error message ("second_factor_failure" or "2-step verification failed") in its account activity logs. This message appears both when a user enters the wrong 2FA code and when someone tries to log in with an incorrect password. This mislabeling leads users to believe their passwords have been compromised, causing unnecessary anxiety and security measures. Coinbase is aware of the issue and plans to change the error message for incorrect passwords, but a timeline is not available. This misleading message is also being exploited by scammers. Coinbase reminds users that they will never contact you by phone or text.
