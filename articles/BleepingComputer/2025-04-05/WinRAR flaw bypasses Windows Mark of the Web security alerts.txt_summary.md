A medium-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-31334) exists in WinRAR versions prior to 7.11 that allows attackers to bypass the Mark of the Web (MotW) security warning in Windows and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability involves using a specially crafted symbolic link to point to an executable, allowing it to run without the usual warning about potentially harmful files downloaded from the internet. While creating symlinks requires administrator privileges, this bypass is significant because attackers have previously exploited MotW vulnerabilities to deliver malware, including state-sponsored actors. WinRAR version 7.11 addresses this issue and also offers a feature to remove potentially sensitive information from the MotW data stream.
