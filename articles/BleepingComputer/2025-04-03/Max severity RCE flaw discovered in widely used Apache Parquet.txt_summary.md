A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2025-30065, affects all Apache Parquet versions up to 1.15.0. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the deserialization of untrusted data within specially crafted Parquet files, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, service disruption, or ransomware attacks.  The vulnerability, discovered by Amazon researcher Keyi Li and carrying a CVSS v4 score of 10.0, was addressed in version 1.15.1.  Exploitation requires tricking a system into importing a malicious Parquet file.  While no active exploitation has been observed, the widespread use of Parquet in big data environments (including Hadoop, AWS, Google, Azure, and companies like Netflix and Uber) makes this a significant threat. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.15.1 or, if that's not immediately possible, carefully validate or avoid untrusted Parquet files and increase monitoring of systems handling them.  Endor Labs suggests the problem was introduced in Parquet version 1.8.0 and advises coordinated checks with developers and vendors to determine which Parquet versions are used in production software stacks.
