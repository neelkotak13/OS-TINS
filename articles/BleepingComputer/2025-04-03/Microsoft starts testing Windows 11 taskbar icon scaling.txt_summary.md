Microsoft is testing a taskbar icon scaling feature for Windows 11 (version 24H2) in the Beta and Dev channels. This feature automatically scales down taskbar icons when the taskbar becomes crowded, allowing users to access more apps without needing a secondary menu. Users can choose when scaling occurs (when full, never, or always). Additionally, Microsoft is rolling out a test remediation package for the Quick Machine Recovery (QMR) tool and a basic search history feature for the Recall function on Copilot+ PCs. Finally, the article highlights the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks.
