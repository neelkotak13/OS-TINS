The Hunters International Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group, despite announcing a shutdown in November 2024, has rebranded and relaunched as an extortion-only operation called "World Leaks" on January 1, 2025. This shift is motivated by declining profitability and increased risk associated with ransomware attacks. World Leaks uses a custom-built data exfiltration tool, an upgraded version of a tool previously used by Hunters International affiliates. Hunters International, known for targeting various platforms and architectures and claiming over 280 attacks, gained notoriety for breaches of organizations like Tata Technologies, AutoCanada, the U.S. Marshals Service, and Fred Hutch Cancer Center. They demanded ransom amounts ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.
