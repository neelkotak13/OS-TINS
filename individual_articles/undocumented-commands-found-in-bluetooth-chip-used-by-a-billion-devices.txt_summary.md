Researchers at Tarlogic Security discovered 29 undocumented commands in the ESP32 microchip's Bluetooth firmware, which could be exploited for attacks such as spoofing devices, accessing data, and establishing persistence. While presented as a "backdoor," Espressif, the chip's manufacturer, claims they are debug commands for internal testing and pose a low security risk, though they will be removed in a future update. The discovery, tracked as CVE-2025-27840, raises concerns about potential malicious implementations and supply chain attacks. Some commenters debate whether the undocumented commands constitute a true "backdoor" or simply reflect common practices in firmware development, while others highlight the potential for lateral attacks and espionage.
